# Telling Stories with Data Assignment 4 : Project Part 1

### Project Topic : The impact of abrogation of article 370 on Kashmir

### Outline :
**High Level Summary of the Project:**
In 2019, article 370 was repealed in Kashmir, that gave Kashmir special powers like having it's own flag, it's own constitution. This gave the Indian central government more control over Jammu & Kashmir (a highly disputed region between India and Pakistan). With this project, I hope to explain the article, and the impact of it's abrogation on the people of Kashmir, by addressing impact on Economy, Stress and Psychological Conditions, Education etc. 

The call to action here would be the direction to donate in the following ways:

### Method and Medium :
I plan on using shorthand for the purposes of this project. I plan to use all the articles that I have highlighted in the section above to add pictures and statistics about the conditions in Kashmir. 

This will serve as a good place with information and images that educate people about what the people of Jammu & Kashmir go through every day. Through the call to action (highlighted above), the users will also be able to contribute to the cause.
