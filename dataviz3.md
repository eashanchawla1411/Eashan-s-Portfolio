# Telling Stories with Data Assignment 3

I decided to critique and redesign the visual on the following link: [Dropout Rate in India](https://data.gov.in/major-indicator/drop-out-rate)

The initial visual is shown below:

### My critique of the visuals

In my opionion, the following things don't work / can be improved upon in this visual:
1. The visuals don't tell us what's happening on a broader level, even though the dataset does contain that information. 
2. Essentially, we have the same graph (bar chart) repeated 4 times, but in 2 different ways (column and row bar chart). This means that even though a bar chart is pretty easy to interpret, having different orientations requires some level of re-learning / re-understanding to be performed by the user which takes some time. 
3. Each graph uses a different color. A more efficient way would be to have the same color across charts and using a gradient color scheme where the higher the value, the darker the color.
