# Telling Stories with Data Assignment 2

### Part 1: Adding a pre-built visual from [data.oecd.org]( https://data.oecd.org/)

**The graph below shows general government debt to GDP ratio for various countries.** This is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. 

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/69BF" width="900" height="525" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/69BF" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2018</a></iframe>

In the next section, I visualized the same data, but in a different way. 

### Part 2: Visualizing the same data using Flourish

**I visualized the same data using [Flourish](flourish.studio).**

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4276039"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


### Part 3: Visualizing the same data using Flourish

**I visualized the same data using [Flourish](flourish.studio).**
Here, I tried multiple types of visualizations, each of which had their own pros and cons. 

**Iteration 1:** 


<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4280910"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This iteration allows a user to filter on the year and compare the values for different countries together. Due to the presence of multiple columns/ bars, a certain shimmer effect is created that can be distracting. 

**Iteration 2:**

In this iteration, giving a filter for countries instead of year allowed for the creation of a time series graph (one for each country). 


<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4280878"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

The idea was initially to have multiple lines indicating various countries in grey, and one country in color (the one that is selected). But, Flourish didn't allow me to do that.
