### Part 3

#### Some changes made
I made all changes that I had indicated in the [Part 2](FinalProjectPt2.md) page. Some specific changes made are given below:
1. **Title change**: Change the title from Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars to Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars?. Adding the question mark indicates leaving the decision for the user to make instead of making a statement. 
2. **Correcting the size issues**: I was able to correct the sizing issues in Tableau using custom sizing. 
3. **Changing the call to action**: The initial plan was to change the text color on the donate page / change the background image itself. However, I completely redesigned this page. On the left, we have now a quote indicating the beauty of Kashmir and on the right we have buttons with links on more info and links to donate and help the people.
4. **Changing the title of the graphs to indicate the point I am trying to make.**
5. **Changing the color scheme**: Change the color scheme in the visual showing the unemployment before and after the unemployment to more contrasting colors like red and grey instead of grey and white. I also change the bubble chart to a simple bar chart, also changing the color scheme to a gradient (where higher the value, brighter the color). 

#### Design decisions:
An important design decision I made was that of using a background of black color against callouts in red to bring out the effect of negative events that our mind associates with the two dark colors. 

#### Adjustments to the story:
I made sure that I showed the data the way it is i.e. I did not manipulate the data /charts in order to make a point. In addition to this, I also realized that I could tell a better story if I were to add a personal touch or the story of a person who was actually impacted by the changes in Jammu Kashmir i.e. what happened with Bashir Ahmed.
