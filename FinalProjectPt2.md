### User Research Protocol
---
#### A. Target Audience

1. Target Audience: People outside of Kashmir that could be educated about the problems faced by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Sample: 3 Indian students at Carnegie Mellon University.

#### B. Identification of Representative Individuals to Interview
India and Pakistan are 2 countries that are ranked 142 and 145 respectively in the world press freedom rankings among 180 countries in the world. In such countries, the governments have a lot of control over what the media can / cannot present to the people. Therefore, my target audience for the purposes of this project would be the citizens of India and Pakistan. 

In addition to that, I would want the project to be simple enough so that anyone, who is not aware of the problems faced by the people of Kashmir and how it has impacted them, to be able to understand it after going through it once. 

Based on the circle of people that I know, I selected the following users to show my work to:
Sample Selected: 3 Indian Citizens (2 Male, 1 Female)

#### C. Interview script 

**Part 1**
Brief introduction – share your name. 

Very brief discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on a project I am working on and have created a website for. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘test’ I mean I’m testing the prototype of my website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”

**Main Section**
Ask: What’s your job? What do you do?

"I've sent a link to the published prototype in our zoom chat ([Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/kashmir--a--state--behind-bars/index.html)). I would request you to share your screen, so we can discuss as you navigate the website. Please feel free to stop and notify me if there's somethign that you find confusing. Let me know if there's something that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. I would encourage you to focus on the message and the overall design of the website, rather than the issues that currently persist with the size of the graphs in the website."

As they work through the website: Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage them to follow their own process (i.e. it’s fine for them to do one read-through), and respond to any questions with further discussion.
1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?"
2. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" or "Who do you think this site is for?"
3. "What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"

**Wrap Up**
“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”

#### D. Findings from the interviews

I interviewed 3 users (User 1, User 2, User 3). The findings for each user is as given below:

#### User 1:
---

**Negatives**
1. Images don't correspond the timeline shown at the beginning of the page. 
2. For the statistic showing the amount lost in the first 120 days of the abrogation, it would be better to show 2 billion instead of the larger number 2,000,000,000 etc.
3. The colors in the unemployment chart (showing the change in unemployment before and after abrogation), aren't contrasting enough to draw attention. 
4. Title of the graph showing the Causalities before announcement, after announcement and after the abrogation becoming official does not drive home the point that there was a significant drop in militant activities after the abrogation (which is a positive outcome of the abrogation).

**Positives**
1. The story is clear and understandable with an intention to show a timeline of the problem, which helps people who aren't aware of the problem understand it. 
2. Good color scheme, and use of graphs to drive home points. 

#### User 2:
---

**Negatives**
1. For the statistic showing the amount lost in the first 120 days of the abrogation, it would be better to show 2 billion instead of the larger number 2,000,000,000 etc.
2. Bar graph showing the sector wise losses might be a better way to show the information as opposed to a table with colors. 
3. It might be helpful to see casualties on the graph that shows the casualties with data. I can understand that there was a significant drop after abrogation, but I would like it if I could see the values. 
4. Change color of the text in the last callout section. 

**Positives**
1. It helps to see the timeline before the actual story begins. 
2. Images do a good job providing context with the timeline. They could be aligned better. 
3. Graphs are clean and clear. 

#### User 3:
---

**Negatives**
1. The first point in the timeline of 1947 has too much text in it. 
2. It is not clear what the use of the map is as an image and would be difficult for someone with no context of the problem to understand. 
3. Images do not correspond with the timeline. 
4. The year to which the data belongs not mentioned in the title of the graph showing that India has the largest count of shutdowns as compared to other countries. 
5. Might be more impactful to know that the economy lost 2 billion dollars instead of the actual complete number. 
6. Null value appearing in the table showing sector wise losses. 
7. It might be helpful to change the title from a statement to a question i.e. from **Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars** to **Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars?**.
8. In the bubble chart, we could change the color scheme. Currently the higher value has a lighter color. I associate that with lower values, and therefore it could be misleading. 
9. If we don't complete the scroll into the donate page, the text color makes it difficult to read. 

**Positives**
1. Nice story of chronological flow with impactful images. 
2. Strong picture showing the communications blockade. 
3. Well highlighted graphs. 
4. Good color scheme followed. 

#### E. Changes I plan to implement
1. Change the title from **Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars** to **Kashmir: a 'state' behind bars?**.
2. Correct the sizing issues faced due to Tableau. 
3. Change the text color on the donate page / change the background image itself. 
4. The title of the last visual can be changed to point out that there was a sharp decline in the militant activities. This could be done through statistics. 
5. Change the number in the statistic for losses to the economy from the actual complete number to 2 billion. All users agreed that this would be more impactful. 
6. Change the color scheme in the visual showing the unemployment before and after the unemployment to more contrasting colors like red and grey instead of grey and white. 
7. Change the color scheme of the bubble chart showing the mental illnesses caused, since it is currently misleading the audience by showing the higher value in a lighter color. 
8. I will try to rectify the problem where the images in the timeline don't really correspond to the point being made in the text due to alignment issues.
