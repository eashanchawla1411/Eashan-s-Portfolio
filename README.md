# Eashan Chawla's Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

Welcome to my portfolio!

## About me
Hello! I am a second year master's student at CMU with an interest in Data Science/ Machine Learning. I have extensive experience in Predictive Analytics and Business Intelligence through my work at Ernst and Young, Tesla and through numerous projects at CMU.

## What I hope to learn 
I hope that I can learn to think carefully about what visuals I present and how I do it. I hope that this class can teach me how to build visualizations/sketches that help me get the message accross in the most effcient and understandable way possible. To summarize, after completion of the class, I see myself having the following:
1. A publicly accessible body of work. 
2. The knowledge on how to use color effectively. 
3. Selecting visuals that best tell the story behind the data.
