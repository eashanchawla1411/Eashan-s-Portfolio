Welcome to my public portfolio. 

## About me
Analytics is something that has always piqued my interest. After coming to CMU, I realized that this love for analytics and deriving insight from data goes beyond just that. Being introduced to machine learning, data science and the work done within this field at CMU historically, has strengthened my belief that ML/Data Science can be used to help businesses and people make better decisions and I hope to be a part of this growing field.
