# Eashan Chawla's Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data

Welcome to my portfolio!

## About me
Hello! I am a second year master's student at CMU with an interest in Data Science/ Machine Learning. I have extensive experience in Predictive Analytics, Data Analytics and some experience in Business Intelligence through my work at Ernst and Young, Tesla and through numerous projects at CMU. Please feel free to send me a message on LinkedIn if you would like to learn more. 

My contact details:
1. [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eashanchawla/)
2. Email id: (echawla@andrew.cmu.edu).

## What I hope to learn 
I hope that I can learn to think carefully about what visuals I present and how I do it. I hope that this class can teach me how to build visualizations/sketches that help me get the message accross in the most effcient and understandable way possible. To summarize, after completion of the class, I see myself having the following:
1. A publicly accessible body of work. 
2. The knowledge on how to use color effectively. 
3. Selecting visuals that best tell the story behind the data.
