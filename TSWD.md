# Eashan Chawla's Portfolio

Welcome to my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! I am a second year master's student at CMU with an interest in Data Science/ Machine Learning. I have extensive experience in Predictive Analytics and Business Intelligence through my work at Ernst and Young, Tesla and through projects at CMU. 

# What I hope to learn from this class
I hope that after taking this class, I can be more thoughtful about the visualizations I make in terms of the message it conveys and how it does so.

Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
